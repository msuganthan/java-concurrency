/**
 * Java does provide its owm implementation of Semaphore, however, Java's semaphore is initialized with an initial
 * number of permits, rather than the maximum possible permits and the develop is expected to take care of always
 * releasing the intended number of maximum permits.
 *
 * Briefly, a semaphore is a construct that allows some threads to access a fixed set of resources in parallel. Always think
 * of a semaphore as having a fixes number of permits to give out. Once all the permits are given out, requesting threads,
 * needs to wait for a permit to be returned before proceeding forward.
 *
 * Task is to implement a semaphore which takes in its constructor the maximum number of permits allowed and is also
 * initialized with the same number of permits
 */

/**
 * We need a function to `gain the permit` and a function to `return the permit`
 *
 * 1. acquire() function to simulate gaining   a permit.
 * 2. release() function to simulate releasing a permit.
 *
 * The constructor accepts an integer parameter defining the number of permits available with the semaphore.
 * Internally we need to store a count which keeps track of the permits given out so far.
