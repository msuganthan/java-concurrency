/**
 * A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n chairs, and a barber chair for giving haircuts.
 *  1. If there is no customers to be served, the barber goes to sleep.
 *  2. If a customer enter the barbershop and all the chairs are occupied, the the customer leaves the shop.
 *  3. If the barber is busy, but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs.
 *  4. If the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber.
 *
 *  Write a program to co-ordinate the interaction between the barber and the customers.
 *
 *  Solution:
 *
 *  *. A customer enters the shop and if all N chairs are occupied, he leaves. This hints at maintaining a count of the waiting customers.
 *  *. If any of the N chairs are free, the customer takes up the chair to wait for his turn. Note this translates to
 *      using a semaphore on which threads that have found a free chair wait on before being called in by the barber
 *      for a haircut.
 *
 *  *. If a customer enter the shop and the barber is asleep it implies there are no customers in the shop. The just-entered
 *     customer thread wakes up the barber thread. This sounds like using a signaling construct to wake up the barber thread.
 *
 *  We'll have a class which will expose two APIs one for the barber thread to execute and the other for customers.
