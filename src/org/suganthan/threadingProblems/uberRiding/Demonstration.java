/**
 * Imaginary Uber ride problem where Republicans and Democrats can't be seated as a minority in a four passenger car.
 *
 * Your task as the Uber developer is to model the ride requestors as threads. Once an acceptable combination of riders
 * is possible, threads are allowed to proceed to ride.
 *
 * Each thread invokes the method { @see seated() } when selected by the system for the next ride. When all the
 * threads are seated, any one of the four threads can invoke the method drive() to inform the driver to start the ride.
