 *
 * Here you are having two threads
 * 1. main-thread
 * 2. child-thread
 * Based on the variable RUNNING, the child thread would start its execution.
 *
 * 1. With the normal declaration, when the main thread changes the RUNNING variable value it won't be visible to child thread.
 *
 * 2. Whereas if the variable RUNNING is declared as volatile the change would reflect to the child thread immediately.
 *
 * Reason: If the variable RUNNING is declared normal variable, the changes are visible only in local memory
 * If the variable is declared as volatile, the changes are available in common memory.
