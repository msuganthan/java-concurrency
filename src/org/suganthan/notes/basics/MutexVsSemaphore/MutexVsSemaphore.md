**_Mutex_**: Mutex allows only a single thread to access a resource or critical section. Once a thread acquires mutex, all other threads attempting to acquire the same mutex are blocked until the first thread releases the mutex.

**_Semaphore_**: Semaphore, on the other hand, is used for limiting access to a collection of resources. Think of semaphore as having a limited number of permits to give out. If the sempahore has given out all the permits it has, then any new thread that comes along requesting for a permit will be blocked, till an earlier thread with a permit returns it to the semaphore. **A typical example would be a pool of database connections that can be handed out to requesting thread** 

A semaphore with a single permit is called a **binary semaphore** and often thought of as an equivalent of a mutex, which isn't completely correct. Semaphores can also be used for signaling among threads. This is an important distinction as it allows threads to **cooperatively work towards completing a tasks**.

**_Difference_**: Semaphore can potentially act as a mutex if the permits it can give out is set to 1. However, the most important difference between the two is that in case of a mutes the same thread must call acquire and subsequent release on the mutex whereas in case of a binary semaphore, different thread can call acquire and release on the semaphore. Different threads can call acquire and release on the semaphore.
