Critical Section:
=================
    Any piece of code that has the possibility of being executed concurrently by more that one thread of the application
    and exposes any shared data or resources used by the application for access.

Race Condition:
===============

    It happens when threads run through critical sections without thread synchronization. In the race condition, threads
    access shared resources or program variables that might be worked on by other threads at the same time causing the
    application data to be inconsistent.
