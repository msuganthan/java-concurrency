**_Monitor_**: Monitor is a mutex and then some.

In a multithreaded applications, a thread needs to wait for some program predicate to be true before it can proceed forward. Think about a producer/consumer application. If the producer hasn't produced anything the consumer can't consume anything, so the consumer must **wait on** a predicate that lets the consumer know that something has indeed been produced.
